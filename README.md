1. Overview of Project

The purpose of the project is to discover temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The following shows summary statistics for the months of June and December given the provided information.

2. Key differences in results between June and December across all recorded years.

  - June Summary Statistics

  - Key differences
As we can see the three key differences are the minimum temparatures (June: 64 degrees versus December: 56 degrees), standard deviation (June 3.2574 versus December 3.745), and the mean temperature (June: 74.94 versus December 71.04). Although slight, these differences are key indicators as to the viability of a surf and ice cream shop business. 

3. Summary

 The differences between the months are not too significant. There is a mild difference in minimum temperature, and a negligable difference in mean temperature between June and December. Along with the precipitation records, there is not much overall rainfall difference between the months. Some more data analysis to perform should include typhoon season for hawaii, and whether some points snow. These analysis will dictact whether people would indeed want to surf and eat ice cream year round in Hawaii.
